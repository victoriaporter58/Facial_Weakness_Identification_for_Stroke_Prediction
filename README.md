# Identifying Pathological Facial Weakness using Fuzzy Inference

This project looks to build upon existing work to encode the decision making expertise of neurologists in a computational model. The ambition for this research is to create a computational tool to support paramedics and other emergency medical providers in accurately detecting the presence of stroke thus enabling the early onset of treatment and improving quality of life.
